# Thermal_Diffuse_Scattering

In this folder, I present my research that I did over the course of Summer 2015 and Summer 2016. This research focuses on understanding how a thermal gradient across the crystal influences the magnitude of the phonon modes in a crystal. Phonons are pseudo-particles which express the relative magnitude and frequency of inter-atomic vibrations in a crystal. As such, they are largely responsible for the propagation of sound and energy through a crystal. Please refer to the included TDSSummer2016 PDF document for more details.

By gaining a greater understanding of how thermal gradients influence certain phonon modes, we can inhibit heat transmission by quenching those modes, which has potential applications in optimizing thermal electric devices.
